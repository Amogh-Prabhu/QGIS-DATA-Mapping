 ## Description
 > This project is the analysis on the weather data of different cities in India which was done by creating a .csv file with the maximum, minimum temperature and rainfall data of the cities along with their coordinates. 
 > 
 > This mapped data can be used in many areas where knowledge of climate of a city is very important. (E.g., Setting up an industry whose product's quality depends on the climate)
